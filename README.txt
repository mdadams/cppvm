======

This software package provides a script that can be used to build a VM
disk image with a basic C++ development environment.

These scripts were written by Michael Adams (mdadams@ece.uvic.ca).

bin/make_vm_image
This script can be used to build a VM disk image that contains a
C++ development environment based on Fedora Linux.

bin/make_ubuntu_32bit
This is just a very simple utility for building a stripped down
32-bit x86 VM disk image based on Ubuntu Linux for testing on a 32-bit
architecture (since it is becoming increasingly difficult to find 32-bit
test environments).
